# SBSAnimoji

Fooling around with Apples private framework AvatarKit, the framework used in Messages.app for recording Animoji videos.

### What you get

- An example of how to use Apples AvatarKit.
- Share your Animoji videos with the native share sheet.
- Export videos to your photo library from the native sheet sheet.
- Record Animoji videos of up to 20 seconds. Currently looking into extending this duration.


### What you don't get

- Error handling. Should you encounter an error, try restarting the app.

# Notice

This project relies heavily on Apples private API and you should therefore not try to submit this code to App Store.
